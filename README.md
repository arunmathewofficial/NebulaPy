## Overview
NebulaPy is a Python library that generates synthetic emission maps from PION simulation data, which utilize an advanced multi-ion non-equilibrium solver for ionized astrophysical plasmas with arbitrary elemental abundances. NebulaPy also supports energy binning of stellar atmosphere models, including Atlas, Potsdam, and CMF, across a wide range of metal abundances for radiative sources used in PION simulations.
